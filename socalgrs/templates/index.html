Welcome to Southern California Garden Railway Society
The Southern California Garden Railway Society was established in 1986, and now has over 100 family memberships in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties.   

SoCalGRS promotes public interest in large-scale model railroading, both inside and outdoors, in the greater Southern California area through member gatherings, a monthly newsletter and workshops on various aspects of the garden railroading hobby.

All SoCalGRS activities promote friendship among people having similar interests.

A key activity of SoCalGRS is the sponsorship of monthly garden railroad open houses, showcasing operational garden railroads where members exchange ideas on railroad construction and operation.

SoCalGRS members continue to play significant roles in the development and maintenance of permanent G-gauge public garden railroads, such as the large exhibit at The Living Desert in Palm Desert.  Our Society also provides temporary exhibits for various venues around Southern California.

We are enthusiastic, and dedicated to the hobby of garden railroading. We encourage all prospective garden railroaders to join our organization.
